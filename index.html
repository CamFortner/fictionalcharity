      Our charity is called, "Broke Teacher". We help provide money for teachers
      so they don't have to use their hard earned money to buy school supplies
      for students or for their classrooms. For this charity, you can donate as
      much as you want. Every little bit helps.

      We'll ask the teachers to come up with a list of the supplies needed for
      the school year. Once they're done with the list, we buy the supplies from
      the money donated, and gift them to the teachers. This prevents them from
      using their hard earned money. Teachers need your support now more than
      ever.
